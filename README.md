Our project focuses on the electric dipole moment that occurs in chemical bonds, and shows a simulation between a chlorine ion and an H2O molecule to show the effects of this dipole on the rotational torque of the molecules. An important note is that we assume the canvas is a 2-D space.

We first allow the user to select a second particle, either another chlorine ion or H2O molecule to add onto the screen in addition to the chlorine ion particle that we have preset to be placed initially. The user can use sliders to adjust the position of the second particle, and we have restricted the location to be somewhere that doesn't overlap with the existing chlorine ion.

After generating the second particle, there are options for the users, including a "run simulation," "show dipole arrow," or "enter dipole electric field visualization mode."

The run simulation option shows the torque of the H2O molecule after the e-field from its dipole and chlorine ion have been calculated and movement of particles is enabled. Graphs are shown to show the torque of the H2O molecule with respect to its angle

The dipole arrow option shows the dipole direction of any molecule that has a dipole moment (only H2O), and it follows the spinning of the molecule.

The dipole electric field visualization mode places the user in a new canvas with a positively charged and negatively charged ion that are preset into the simulation, with arrows showing the electric field lines caused by the dipole. The user can use sliders to adjust the positions of the particles, and the e-field will change accordingly with the positions of the particles. Note that the arrows are meant to flicker, it is simply the process of deleting old arrows from previous positions of the ions, and also the empty space closer to the particles doesn't show that there are no electric field lines there, it's just so that the arrows don't overlaps so much to make a mess in that area.
